     <p class="txt">Cricket is the most popular sport in Bangladesh. There is a strong domestic league which on many occasions also saw Test players from many countries (Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and England) gracing the cricket fields of Bangladesh. In the year 2000 Bangladesh became a full member of the International Cricket Council, which allows the national team to play Test cricket. The Bangladesh national cricket team goes by the nickname of the Tigers – after the Royal Bengal Tiger. At present among the most popular 
         cricket players in Bangladesh are Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, 
         Mustafizur Rahman and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. Becoming champion in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket 
         World Cup is the country's biggest cricketing achievement. <br> <br> </p>

                     <p class="txt">The history of cricket in Bangladesh predates the foundation of the Bangladeshi state in 1971 by nearly two centuries. Cricket was introduced to Bengal by the British in the eighteenth century but its growth in East Bengal was slow. Following Partition and the creation of East Pakistan, both first-class and Test cricket were played there during the 1950s and 1960s. Although cricket continued to be popular after independence, especially in Dhaka, the country lost first-class status and had to establish itself in international competition as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Bangladeshi international cricket began in 1976/77 when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) came to play against the Bangladesh national side. MCC played their first match against a regional team in Rajshahi with the match ending in a draw. The first unofficial Test against the MCC was played at Dhaka on 4 January 1977. <br> <br>

                        The Bangladesh national team then went on to play against teams like Sri Lanka, Deccan Blues and MCC in the later years. <br> <br>
                        
                        After winning the 1997 ICC Trophy and making a good showing at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Bangladesh created its National Cricket League (NCL) in 1999–2000 to prepare the way for full membership of the ICC. This was granted in 2000 and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) was formally established. In November 2000, the Bangladesh national team played its inaugural Test match against India at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka; India won by 9 wickets. <br> <br>
                        
                        The 2000–01 season saw the beginning of first-class domestic competition in Bangladesh, although the country had already staged first-class matches against touring teams in the previous year. The Green Delta National Cricket League was constituted as the first-class championship and the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea One-Day League as the premier limited overs competition. In 2000–01, both titles were won by Biman Bangladesh Airlines. <br> <br>
                        
                        The National Cricket League had in fact been inaugurated in the 1999–2000 season but was not then first-class. In 2000–01, eight teams played 12 matches each in two groups. Group A consisted of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Chittagong Division, Rajshahi Division and Dhaka Division. Group B had Dhaka Metropolis, Khulna Division, Barisal Division and Sylhet Division. Four teams qualified for a final stage in which they each played a further 8 games. <br> <br>
                        
                        In 2001–02, Ispahani Mirzapore Tea became the sponsor of the National Cricket League in addition to the One-Day League.</p>
