                 <h1>Bangladesh Cricket</h1>
                 
                 <p class="txt">Cricket is the most popular sport in Bangladesh. There is a strong domestic league which on many occasions also saw Test players from many countries (Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and England) gracing the cricket fields of Bangladesh. In the year 2000 Bangladesh became a full member of the International Cricket Council, which allows the national team to play Test cricket. The Bangladesh national cricket team goes by the nickname of the Tigers – after the Royal Bengal Tiger. At present among the most popular 
                    cricket players in Bangladesh are Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, 
                    Mustafizur Rahman and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. Becoming champion in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket 
                    World Cup is the country's biggest cricketing achievement.<br> <br> </p> <br><br>
                    <h1>NEWS</h1>
                    <h3>Nasum four-for helps Bangladesh secure first-ever T20 win over Australia in low-scoring opener
                    </h3>
                    <img src="/img/aus win.png" alt=""> 
                    <p class="txt">Asked to bat first, efforts from Shakib Al Hasan (36) and Mohammad Naim (30) pushed the Tigers to 
                        131 for seven at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Tuesday evening. <br> Nasum then went through the Aussie 
                        batting line-up with his slow left-arm orthodox, picking up 4-19 in the
                         four-over quota as Bangladesh took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. <br><br>

                        Seamers Mustafizur Rahman and Shoriful Islam chipped in with two wickets each to bundle out the tourists for 108. <br>
                        
                        The only Aussie resistance came from Mitchell Marsh who scored a run-a-ball 45 before falling to Nasum. <br>
                        
                        In pursuit of a modest 132, Australia had a stuttering start when Mahedi Hasan went through the gates of opener 
                        Alex Carey with the first ball of the innings. <br> <br> 
                        The track offered turn for the spinners while the seamers met low-bounce on the pitch. <br>

                        In trying to break free of Bangladeshi spinners who displayed much control and confidence, Wade went 
                        after a wayward one from Nasum but ended up sweeping to short-fine leg where Mustafizur pouched it safely. <br>
                        
                        The visitors plunged further into trouble when Ashton Agar (7) went back hit wicket off Nasum before 
                        Marsh and Ashton Turner (10) sliced Mustafizur to extra cover, as Marsh kept running out of partners. <br>
                        
                        Nasum, who ended with a career-best haul, bagged Marsh’s scalp for his fourth to cap off a brilliant
                         performance with Australia still 47 runs shy and less than five overs remaining. <br> <br>
                         Earlier, Australia had the better of the opening stages of the game despite two sixes from Naim with Josh Hazlewood (3-24) leading the charge. <br>

                         The Tigers looked uncomfortable from the start as well when Naim almost
                          chopped on to the wicket, which his partner Soumya Sarkar (2) did in the fourth over off Hazlewood. <br> <br>
                          Reduced to 104 for five with three overs remaining, a crucial cameo from Afif Hossain (23 off 17) pushed Bangladesh 
                          to the modest total, which ultimately proved too much for Australia to chase down. <br> <br>

                          The 26-year-old southpaw Nasum was adjudged Man of the Match. <br><br>
                          
                          At the presentation ceremony, Mahmudullah said: “We had a team talk that we were 10 runs short, 
                          so we have to field well. It was outstanding, the hunger and energy was there. The bowlers executed their
                           plans really well.” <br><br>
                          
                          “You need to have an attacking mindset with the ball early on, that's what we did. I'm not over the top,
                           we've won, it's gone. Now it's time to focus on the next game and try and be on top from the first ball, 
                           try and manage ourselves, keep our feet on the ground."
